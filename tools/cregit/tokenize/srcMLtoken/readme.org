* Introduction

srcMLtoken transcodes the output of srcML (www.srcml.org) to a tokenized view that can be used by cregit.

* Requirements

- srcml must be installed and in the PATH (www.srcml.org)

* How to use

The input of srml2token is the output of srcml. srml2token takes no parameters, and it reads its input from stdin and writes to stdout.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
srcml -l C --position <filename> | srcml2token
#+END_SRC

* How to build

- It requires xerces to be installed
- simply run make 

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
make
#+END_SRC

* TODO

- create a cmake configuration file for it

* License

The code is mostly derived from the examples of Xerces, hence it is under the
