# Add every <org>/<repo> directory under the Defects4J GitHub mirror
# to the current user's global Git configuration as a safe directory.
# This avoids "unsafe repository" errors when the repository owner UID
# differs from the current user.

# Usage:
#   bash register_safe_directories.sh
#
# The script is idempotent: running it multiple times simply adds the same
# paths again; Git ignores duplicates.
